- tobin.py convert string (e.g.0000000000001010) repr to bytes (little endian)
- compile xxx.asm to xxx.hack using nand tools
  (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZzcMIUETv3u3sdpM_oTJSTetpVee3KZ)
- cycle counter to solve endles loop problem of nand code
- RAM and ROM (nand hack cpu is a harvard architecture) using malloc and
  copy from bin file (generated by tobin.py)
- Warning: wrong casting (uint8, int64 e.g) caused problem in input parsing
- use printf of cpu state (PC, A, D, cycle) for now


16.06.2022 -
- start some docs
- fixed warnings in nand2tetris
- hacked a jit for nand together, 300x faster than the C emulator
- added enough to the parser to parse MIPS

17.06.2022 -
- parse RISC-V model
- progress on generating code for MIPS
- generate (not yet working) code for RISC-V

19.06.2022:
- risc-v works untranslated

20.06.2022:
- risc-v works translated, but some primitives are missing

21.06.2022:
- optimization of bitvectors and integers by size specializing them into the
  64bit fast case and the general big bit vector case using rbigint

22.06.2022:
- introdution to the whole stack of layers for Nico


TODO:
- C Warnings fix in sail code
- Test SetUp. C vs Python (John: run generated C emulator on examples, check output from a test_cemulator.py file, hardcoded)
- add jib code as comment Docstrings in generated code (John?)
- add assert that we are on a 64bit system (John)
- make clean target (John)
- nand: dump state into file at the end
- commit sail notes (John)
- meta: make github issues (john)
